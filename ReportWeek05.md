### **2. Introduction** 
> ## [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/)
ArduPilot is a trusted, versatile, and open source autopilot system supporting many vehicle types: multi-copters, traditional helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, boats, submarines, rovers and more.

> ## [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/)
Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

Typical uses of Gazebo include:

- testing robotics algorithms,

- designing robots,

- performing regression testing with realistic scenarios

A few key features of Gazebo include:

- multiple physics engines,

- a rich library of robot models and environments,

- a wide variety of sensors,

- convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces
